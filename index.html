                <h2>Linear Regression (Fall 2025)</h2>
                <section>I was taking an Engineering Probability and Stats course at the U and wanted some interactive way to see how a line of best fit changed as each new data point was introduced. It's pretty minimal, but it does exactly what I wanted it to.</section>

                <h2>Delaunay Triangulation (Winter 2022)</h2>
                <section>This version includes circumcircles for every unique triplet of points. Their centers are also shown, which could then be used to create a Voronoi diagram. I haven't quite finished that part yet. I'd also like to add the ability to toggle points/circumcircles/edges because as-is it can get visually pretty messy.</section>
